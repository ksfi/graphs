# A Graph class that checks some properties

## Definitions

### • Simple graph
A simple graph $G$ consists of a non-empty finite set $V(G)$ of elements called vertices (or nodes), and a finite set $E(G)$ of distinct unordered pairs of distinct elements of $V(G)$ called edges. We call $V(G)$ the vertex set and $E(G)$ the edge set of $G$.

### • Graph
A general graph or just graph is a simple graph that can contain a loop if it has edges that are joins to themselves.

## Properties

### • Connectedness

A graph is connected if it cannot be expressed as the union of two graphs, and disconnected otherwise.
